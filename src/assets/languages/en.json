        "banner1_nav3": "Grapefruit users earn income by sharing their own resources (bandwidth and storage) to upstream companies, and we will distribute revenue through the form of grapefruit points",
        "banner2_nav1": "Why is there a profit?",
        "banner2_nav2": "With the explosive growth of online video, online live broadcast, Internet of Things 5G artificial intelligence and other industries the demand for bandwidth and storage of enterprises or companies in the industry has also increased exponentially. The bandwidth and storage provided by professional operators cannot fully meet customer needs due to price and other factors. On the other hand the bandwidth and storage resources of a large number of ordinary Internet users are not fully utilized and become idle.",
        "banner2_nav3": "And we will build a global distributed shared storage network through a large number of grapefruit machines. The grapefruit machine is the physical link between the enterprises and the grapefruit users. It outputs the idle resources of the users to enterprises who demands. And the network cost saved for the enterprise will be returned to the majority of the grapefruit users to achieve the ultimate value of sharing.",
        "banner3_nav1": "What is the score?",
        "banner3_nav2": "Grapefruit points are the proof of income after the user shares the resources. The grapefruit product is produced when the user contributes to idle bandwidth and storage.The reward measurement basically follows the principle of more work and more gains, and the more contributions, the higher the reward. We will determine the final score value based on the user's network bandwidth, storage space, online time and other aspects, and allocate points based on the user's share of the total network user contribution.",
        "banner4_nav1": "Integral use",
        "banner4_nav2": "The user's points can be redeemed at any time through our exclusive exchange channel of the Grapefruit APP. Points can be redeemed for physical or direct cash withdrawals or participate in the company's points activities red envelopes sweepstakes mall discounts etc.and enjoy a variety of paid services within the company's value ecosystem. At present the company's idle shared economic system is gradually improving and the value of point redemption will be more diverse.",
        "banner5_nav1": "Precautions",
        "banner5_nav2": "The grapefruit team will continuously scan the equipment and test points. Once the user is discovered to exploit software, hardware and other related vulnerabilities, invade, intercept, destroy, modify the program and use software/hardware with forged or tamper-related information. Forgery of upstream bandwidth, idle storage space, online duration, hardware capabilities, etc. will immediately lock or log off related devices, users will no longer be able to earn points."
